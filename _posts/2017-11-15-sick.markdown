I took PTO because I'm sick. I lay in the bed and watch jekyll tutorial. Why I start learning jekyll? I came across github feature of hosting you own blog. It's appealing idea to manage blog posts in github repository.
You can review the posts before putting them to he blog. So I hear first about jekyll.
